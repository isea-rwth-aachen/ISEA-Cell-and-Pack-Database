About ICPD
==============================
The <a href=http://www.isea.rwth-aachen.de/>ISEA</a> Cell and Pack Database is a cell design model calculating cell performance parameters solely based on design parameters and material characteristics to bridge the gap between material and cell performance. It is a bottom-up database structure along the battery manufacturing process including most intermediate products. It can be applied for both storage of cell characterization data of existing battery cells and virtually cell design for any cell chemistry.


Required Software:
==============================
+ MATLAB
